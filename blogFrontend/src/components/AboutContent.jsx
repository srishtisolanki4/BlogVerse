                 <p className="mt-2 ">
                    Welcome to My Blog – the place where brilliance meets procrastination and half-finished cups of tea.<br/>
                We’re not just another blog — we’re that blog. The one you stumble upon at 2 AM, wondering how you got here after Googling something totally unrelated. Fate? Probably. Regret? Hopefully not.<br/>

               <h className="font-bold text-xl">🧑‍💻 Who Are We?</h> <br/>
                <p className="mt-2 ">We’re a team of highly skilled professionals... okay, it's just one person with Wi-Fi, a keyboard, and trust issues with semicolons. But we do our best.<br/></p>
            </div>

            <div className="mt-3">
               <h className="font-bold text-2xl "> ✍️ What Do We Write About?<br/></h>
               <p className="mt-2 "> <b>Life.</b> The kind that happens between commits, caffeine, and existential dread. Sometimes deep, sometimes just weird stuff that made us think "this could be a blog."<br/>

                <b>Thoughts.</b> Random musings, unpopular opinions, and mildly philosophical rambles no one asked for — but here they are anyway.<br/>

                <b>Code.</b> Tutorials, tips, and tangled logic — sometimes helpful, often questionable, always typed with confidence and minimal debugging.<br/>
                </p>

               <h className="font-bold text-2xl "> 👀 Why Should You Read Our Blog?<br/></h> 
              <p className="mt-2 ">
                Because Netflix asked if you’re still watching, and you needed a break.<br/>
                Because scrolling social media got boring.<br/>
                Because reading our blog makes you feel productive... somehow.<br/>

            <div className="mt-3">
              <h className="font-bold text-2xl "> Still here? Wow.<br/></h> 
                <p className="mt-2 mb-2 ">You’re either very bored or you actually like us. Either way — we respect it.<br/></p>
            </div>

               <i className="mt-2 mb-2 font-bold ">Thanks for stopping by. Come back soon...</i>  <br/>
